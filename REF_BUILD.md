## Adding a build.zig

As a project grows, a build.zig becomes essential.

| Feature                     | Why It Matters                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Named executable            | Produces a `zig-out/bin/your-program` binary                                 |
| Project structure awareness | Supports multiple source files and dependencies                              |
| Reusable builds             | Run `zig build` once, re-run quickly without recompiling every time          |
| Configurable build modes    | Easily switch between `debug`, `release-safe`, `release-fast`, etc.          |
| Editor/tooling support      | Enables integrations like `zls` (Zig Language Server) and VS Code extensions |
| Custom build steps          | Automate file generation, copy assets, run setup scripts                     |
